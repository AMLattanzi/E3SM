# Binary operations diagnostics

In EAMxx, we can perform binary arithmetic operations on pairs of fields
to create new diagnostic outputs. The binary operations diagnostic allows
you to compute element-wise arithmetic operations between two fields.

## Supported operations

The binary operations diagnostic supports four basic arithmetic operations:

| Operator | Symbol | Description |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Addition | `+` | Element-wise addition of two fields |
| Subtraction | `-` | Element-wise subtraction of two fields |
| Multiplication | `*` | Element-wise multiplication of two fields |
| Division | `รท` | Element-wise division of two fields |

## Requirements

For two fields to be compatible for binary operations, they must satisfy:

1. **Same layout**
2. **Same data type**
3. **Same grid**
4. **Compatible units** for addition and subtraction

## Unit handling

The resulting diagnostic field will have units determined by the operation.

## Configuration

To use the binary operations diagnostic, one can request an output
using the general syntax of `<field_1>_<binary_op>_<field_2>`:

- `field_1` is the name of the first input field
- `binary_op` is the operator: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `รท`
- `field_2` is the name of the second input field

## Example

```yaml
field_names:
  - T_mid_*_p_mid
```

## Caveats

- Strictly speaking, multiple operations will take place in order.
  For example, `qc_+_qv_*_p_mid` will first compute `qc + qv`,
  then multiply the result by `p_mid`.
- We only support existing fields in the Field Manager, e.g.,
  grid information like lat, lon, and area are not available.
- We do not support dimensionality broadcasting, so both fields
  must have the same shape.
